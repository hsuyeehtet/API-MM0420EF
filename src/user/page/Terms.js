                <h1>Terms And Conditions</h1>
                    <p>All sales of products and finished goods offered and supplied by Seller to its customer (“Buyer”) for resale shall be pursuant to the following standard terms and conditions. Products may include, but are not limited to hardware products, software (including all open source licensed or distributed by SYNNEX, or incorporated into any software), and services (collectively “Products”). Any conflicting terms in your purchase order or elsewhere are without effect unless signed by the applicable party(ies). All Buyer purchases from SYNNEX are deemed to be purchases pursuant to a written agreement. </p>
                    
                    <p>a. ACCEPTANCE: Buyer’s acceptance of these Terms and Conditions shall be indicated by any of the following, whichever first occurs: (a) Buyer’s written acknowledgement hereof, (b) Buyer’s submission of an order to SYNNEX, regardless of whether the Product(s) ordered is ever delivered or if the purchase order is completely or partially fulfilled, rejected, modified or cancelled; (c) Buyer’s receipt of any part of the items specified for delivery in any purchase order submitted to SYNNEX, (c) Buyer’s application for credit submitted to SYNNEX, (d) accessing any SYNNEX e-commerce web site, or (e) any other act or expression of acceptance by Buyer. Buyer’s acceptance is expressly limited to the Terms and Conditions in their entirety without addition, modification or exception and any term, condition, or proposal hereafter submitted by Buyer (whether oral or in writing), which is inconsistent with or in addition to the Terms and Conditions set forth hereon is objected to and is hereby rejected by Seller. Seller’s silence or failure to respond to any such subsequent term, condition or proposal shall not be deemed to be Seller’s acceptance or approval thereof. </p>
                    
                    <p>b. PRICES: Prices payable by Buyer for the Products are specified on the invoice. Seller does not offer price protection. Buyer shall bear all applicable federal, provincial, municipal and other government taxes (such as sales, use and similar taxes), as well as import or customs duties, license fees and similar charges, however designated, levied on this sale or the Products (or the delivery thereof) or measured by the purchase price hereunder. Seller’s prices do not include such taxes, fees and charges. Exemption certificates must be presented prior to shipment if they are to be honored. To the extent any sale is made without the prior receipt of a valid exemption certificate, Seller expressly reserves the right to include on the invoice for such sale, or to separately invoice Buyer for all applicable taxes, fees and charges and Buyer agrees that these amounts shall be immediately due and payable.</p>

                    <p>c. PAYMENT TERMS: Buyer shall provide all financial information reasonably requested by SYNNEX from time to time for the purpose of establishing or continuing Buyer’s credit limit. Buyer agrees that SYNNEX shall have the right to decline or extend credit to Buyer and to require that the applicable purchase price be paid prior to shipment. SYNNEX shall have the right from time to time, without notice, to change or revoke Buyer’s credit limit on the basis of changes in SYNNEX’s credit policies or Buyer’s financial condition and/or payment record. </p>
                    
                    <p>f. PRODUCT RETURNS: Return of Products purchased from SYNNEX shall be governed by Seller’s product return policies in effect on the date of return. Seller reserves the right to modify or eliminate such policies at any time. Although Seller’s policies may permit Buyer to return Products claimed to be defective under certain circumstances, Seller makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the Products. </p>
